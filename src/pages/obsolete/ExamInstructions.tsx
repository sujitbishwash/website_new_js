              <li>The clock has been set at the server and the countdown timer at the top right corner of the screen will display the remaining time available for you to complete the examination. When the timer reaches zero, the examination will end by itself. You will not be required to end or submit your examination.</li>
              <li>The Question Palette displayed on the right side of screen will show the status of each question using one of the following symbols:
                <ul className="legend">
                  <li><span className="legend-box grey"></span> You have not visited the question yet.</li>
                  <li><span className="legend-box red"></span> You have not answered the question.</li>
                  <li><span className="legend-box green"></span> You have answered the question.</li>
                  <li><span className="legend-box purple"></span> You have not answered the question, but have marked the question for review.</li>
                  <li><span className="legend-box purple"><span className="check-mark">âœ”</span></span> You have answered the question, but marked it for review.</li>

                The Marked for Review status for a question simply indicates that you would like to look at that question again. If a question is answered and Marked for Review, your answer for that question will be considered in the evaluation.
